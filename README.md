This repository contains some simple games that I've had fun building! The games included in this repository include
- Guess the number
  - I'm thinking of a number between 0-100! I'll let you know if your guess is close, and how many tries you took to get it (so you could beat your own record!)
- Tic Tac Toe (2 player)
  - Take a walk down memory lane and have a classic (virtual) tic tac toe showdown with the opponent of your choice
